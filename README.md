In the tournament, players can choose **any region** they want to find the Pok√©mon they would like to submit.

#### Please join Sentor's Discord server in order to submit scores and supporting evidence for grading: https://discord.gg/gdDPQ53Vps <br> Scores must be submitted to the #score-submit channel at the bottom of the PokeMMO category.

## Rules:
| **Rule** | **Details** |
|:-:|-|
| Have Fun üòÅ | We have put these events on to have **friendly competition between PokeMMO players**. Please don't take it seriously- we're here to have fun! |
| One Entry | Only **ONE** Pok√©mon may be submitted as an entry. Once submitted, that Pok√©mon is locked in as the **final choice**! Participants may not resubmit after posting a score. |
| Valid Submit | Entries must be posted in the **#score-submit channel** in Sen's Discord with the required information. |
| Hold On! | **Please do not submit Pok√©mon early!!** It would be a great shame if a Pok√©mon was found to be better than the one already submitted. |
| One Character | We understand players may have multiple accounts. Participants are limited to using only **one character** to find and submit a score from. |
| Limited Time | Participants have a limited time to catch the Pok√©mon they wish to submit. Submissions will close and no more scores can be entered. |
| Banned Ability | Participants must not use Synchronise to manipulate a specific nature onto the submission Pok√©mon. We understand that we do not have any control over this, but it is expected of participants not to cheat. |
| Catch 'Em All | Under no circumstances can a participant breed their submission. All Pok√©mon must be caught in the wild. |
| No Alpha | If there happens to be an Alpha spawn of the **Chase Pok√©mon** at the time of the event, it is banned as a submission Pok√©mon. |
| No Changes | All submissions must remain unchanged (untrained/unevolved...). Evolved or unevolved forms of the **chase Pok√©mon** will not be accepted as a valid entry. |
| OG OT | Participants must be the original owner of the Pok√©mon. |
| Tie Event | In the event of a tie, the winner will be determined by the **earliest catch time**. |

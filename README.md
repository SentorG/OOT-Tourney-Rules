# Quasi-Kaizo IronMON
**A sub-ruleset for Kaizo IronMON**

If your Kaizo IronMON run dies, you have the option to step down the difficulty to be able to "casually" play through the game. This allows everyone to have a second chance if they deem the Pokémon worthy of the Quasi-Kaizo status, allowing viewers to see the epic battles we would have tried to beat Kaizo-style. Or it can be used to simply play through a game casually.

### Main Rule Changes
| Rule | Details |
|-|-|
| Deaths Permitted | Party Pokémon are permitted to faint. A total amount of run-deaths must be recorded and are required to soft-reset to prevent gaining experience. |
| Three-Pokémon Rule |Only three Pokémon are permitted in your party at once. |
| Switching/Sacking | HM friends are permitted to be switched in or sacked during battle to allow a chance to heal. The HM friend cannot use an attacking move. Helpful abilities are permitted. |
| New Permitted Items | Only Poké Balls, Repels, Super Potions and Revives are permitted for purchasing. However, flutes remain banned. |
| Healing | Using Potions/Revives outside of battle is permitted. |
| Four-Item Rule | During battle, a combination of four items are permitted for use. For dungeon battles (such as Gym trainers or the Kimono Girls), only four may be used until the "boss fight". |
| Held Items | All held items (except Leftovers) are permitted for use in battle, but only on the main Pokémon. |
| Teachable TMs | All teachable TMs are permitted for use on the main Pokémon. |
